# Perspective Recitifiaction

Designed for a self-guided course/textbook project, Coding the Matrix by Philip N. Klein.

The prompt is found in the file [Perspective_Lab.pdf](https://github.com/mckqw/PerspectiveRectification/blob/master/perspective_lab.pdf). I produced 90% of the code, with the remaining 10% belonging to the project provided outline.
